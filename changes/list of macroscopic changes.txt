Listed below are major changes which deprecate a significant amount of the codebase. I will be refactoring the codebase as I use it, so don't expect everything to work. It's possible most things won't work.

1. Data loading now renames DataSet keys once and only once in postprocess_frame. 
    This should make it easier to add/modify key renaming. It also makes it easier to determine key names at each stage of data loading.
2. Attributes have been removed from data_vars, so they only exist in the full DataSet. 
    My philosophy here is that functions should always be provided the full DataSet (from which a spectrum can be extracted), so the 
    attrs only need to exist in one place.
3. Configuration has been mostly gutted. Now it simply imports commonly used packages, adds common endstations, and establishes path roots for easier reference to data and figures.
4. Trace has been removed since for me it only makes debugging harder.
